  # Fix RLS policies for customers table

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing RLS policies for customers table
    - Create new policies that allow:
      - Anyone to insert new customers
      - Authenticated users to view and update customers
      - Authenticated users to view their own transactions

  2. Security
    - Maintain RLS enabled
    - Add more permissive policies for customer creation
